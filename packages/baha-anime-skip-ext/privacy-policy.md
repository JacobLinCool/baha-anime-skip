# Privacy Policy

By installing and using the Extension, you agree to the collection, storage, and use of your information as outlined in this Privacy Policy.

## Information We Collect

### Serial Number of Video (SN)

When you use the Extension, we automatically collect the Serial Number (SN) associated with the video you are watching on the Bahamut Anime platform. This SN is used to find and load the skip sections related to the video from remote (configurable) servers.

## How We Use Information

The SN collected is used for the following purposes:

1. To provide the core functionality of the Extension, which includes locating and applying skip sections for the videos you are watching.

## Information Sharing

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your information to external parties. However, we may share the SN with remote servers as configured by you within the Extension settings to fetch the relevant skip sections.

## User Choices

You can configure the remote servers from which the Extension fetches the skip sections. This is entirely optional and can be configured through the Extension settings.

## Changes to Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time. The date of the last modification will be noted at the top of this page. It is your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy periodically.
